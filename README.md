# Drag and Drop Between Two Lists

This is an running example of how to achieve drag and drop between two lists in SAPUI5.

There are 2 lists:
1. List of available options (Source List)
2. Dropable List (Destination)

One can drag and drop options to another list. 
Dragging option from List 1 to List 2, adds the List1 object to List2's model.

Credit to other authors as well from where I learnt.
